- CSS Grid

### What I learned

See the Useful Resources section below.


### Continued development

I honestly really got in my own head about this one. But once I recognized that perfection is neither required nor desired, I let myself get some professional guidance from Kevin Powell. He covered this one on Youtube, and his thinking strategies really helped me to feel like I could have a functional process of my own!

### Useful resources

- [Kevin's awesome video](https://youtu.be/KqFAs5d3Yl8?si=tkTKsNquC5IqiNQC) - This helped me to understand how high quality producing front end developers plan out how they will implement design, organize their HTML and CSS, and make it easy for themselves or others to come back and add on to it.
